# BeMyHero
A community driven **SOS** app that accurately sends your current location to all the app users within a radius of 1 KM. In addition to this, it also informs the police
about an impending danger befalling you. When a users recieves the SOS signal, they can choose to accept it, following which the app will guide them to the victim's location.
The idea behind the app is that the community would come forward to protect each other in situations where assistance from the Police may take time to arrive.
