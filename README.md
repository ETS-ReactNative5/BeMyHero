# BeMyHero

## Inspiration
In the case of emergency, oftentimes the incident escalates by the time police arrives. 
So we came up with an idea that local people (Local heroes) can help you before impending danger.
That gave birth to BeMyHero

## What it does
A community driven SOS app that accurately sends your current location to all the app users within a radius of 1 KM. 
In addition to this, it also informs the police about an impending danger befalling you. When a hero receives the SOS signal, they can choose to accept it, following which the app will guide them to the victim's location. 

## How we built it
- Backend: NodeJS
- Frontend: 
    - Mobile Application: React Native
    - Web Application: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
- Authentication: JWT
- Maps: Google Cloud
- Password Encryption: bcrypt
- Client-Server communication: Socket.io
- UI/UX Design: Figma
- API testing: Postman
## Challenges we ran into

- Advik Singhania
- Securing the application with authentication using JWT and password encryption.
- Client server communication using socket
- Making the front-end using react native which is absolute new to us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Making a beautiful UI.
- Coping with Advik Singhania
- Wrapping the project in the given time frame
- Able to secure the application from various cyber attacks.

## What we learned
- We learned to be aware from snakes.
- Implementing Socket.io
- Various encryption tactics

## What's next for BeMyHero
- Adding AI assistance to detect type of emergency and take action according 
- Making a Hardware to detect emergency situation and handy for the user.
